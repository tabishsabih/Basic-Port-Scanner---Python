# Basic-Port-Scanner---Python

This is a very basic port scanner that I have developed. The templates were already available. I made changes where I deemed it fit.
Currently, it only supports TCP connection. UDP support is not there.
This is more of an academic exercise.

P.S: I have commented in my own language so that if I choose to teach Python in future, language is not a barrier for the students and they can get straight to coding. Don't judge me. I have a masters degree in English Lit. :D
