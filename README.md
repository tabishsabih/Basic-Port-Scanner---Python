# Basic-Port-Scanner---Python

This is a very basic port scanner that I have developed. The templates were already available. I made changes where I deemed it fit.
Currently, it supports both TCP and UDP connections with threading capability.
There are several features which are lacking, like range feature. As of right now, port numbers have to be specified individually.
A range feature could come in handy. Will work on it when I have time.
This is more of an academic exercise.

P.S: I have commented in my own language so that if I choose to teach Python in future, language is not a barrier for the students and they can get straight to coding. Don't judge me. I have a masters degree in English Lit. :D
